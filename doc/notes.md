### Discuss

 - how map reduce works in details
 - spark+hdfs distribution and shuffeling
 - Dijkstra algorithm implementation
 - Minimum spanning tree
 - Implement AsyncLru
 - Systrem design: parking lot
 - Solve sudoku on whiteboard
 - Disjoint sets - applications and impementation
 
 ### Implement
  - distributed log (kafka)
  - kafka streams
  - paxos, raft, gossip (see cassandra) https://raft.github.io/
  - SStable (cassandra)
  - distributed KV - aerospike, etcd
  - search engine - elastic search
  - btree, b+tree - raltional dbs
  - map reduce - hadoop
  - you are given 2 arrays, find if rhere exists a sum of two elements that equals to target. Write an implementation for a  distributed system.
